# Welcome
Hello, and welcome to Greg's blog. 

# First end-to-end DL project

## Background
Feel free to try my bike_classifier_app , which takes and image and determines whether it is (a) a road bike or (b) a mountain bike. The app is hosted for free by mybinder.org, and was created using a jupyter notebook + the voila python package. 

Note that the goal of this project was simply to practice the steps for creating a DL project end-to-end, rather than to create a perfectly polished application. This bike_classifier_app is unlikely to be useful in any capacity, but it is impressive how well it performs given limited training data (100 images per class). 

## Link to the app
